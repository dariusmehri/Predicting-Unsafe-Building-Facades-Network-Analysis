###Research Question:

Can we use a method to predict buildings with facades unsafe to the public?

We are interested in identifying buildings dangerous to public but unknown to the DOB

###Method:

Social network analysis

Steps:

1. Identify bad actors from the façade compliance dataset who have repeated unsafe violations. 

2. Develop “bad actor” risk scale to identify owners of unsafe buildings.

3. Search for buildings owned by the bad actor that are unknown to the DOB (i.e. not on compliance list, no previous façade violations or complaints).

4. Validate model using google maps.

###Data:

DOB compliance data, owners of buildings that are 6 floors or higher required to submit status of facade (safe, unsafe) every facade cycle from 2000 through the present.

###Results:

List of 30 buildings with high risk.

List of 20 buildings with medium risk.

The following pictures show examples of high risk building:
